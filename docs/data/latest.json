Thank you very much everyone!\n\nOriginal post:\n\nI was hoping to purchase a few single-game tickets throughout the season specifically for the Outfield Distract/General Admission option. However, when I look at Ticketmaster for various games throughout the season, those tickets don't seem available for purchase.\n\nDoes anyone know if they’re already sold out, or if they get released at a later date?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!",
