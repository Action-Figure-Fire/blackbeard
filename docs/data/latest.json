          "text": "Hey! I’m an American comedian based in Berlin and I’m bringing my solo show *The American Apology Tour* to Freiburg tomorrow night.\n\nIt’s about living in Germany, being married to a German, becoming a German dog dad, and apologizing on behalf of the United States. A LOT.\n\nThe show has sold out in Berlin and Frankfurt, and I’m excited to bring it to Freiburg for the first time! It’s a small room, with a relaxed vibe. Sooooo....\n\nIf you’re into stand-up or just want something different on a Friday",
