          "text": "I didn't try to buy this year, but I just checked their website and am seating no tickets available for any regular season game this year. Am I correct that every game is now sold out (14 hours after they went on sale to the general public)?\n\nHow was the buying experience for those who attempted it? Did anyone get tickets?  Did the site shutdown, did you have to wait hours in a queue? Did you get tickets you wanted or were there only scattered single bad seats available once you got access?\n\nPeo",

Thank you very much everyone!\n\nOriginal post:\n\nI was hoping to purchase a few single-game tickets throughout the season specifically for the Outfield Distract/General Admission option. However, when I look at Ticketmaster for various games throughout the season, those tickets don't seem available for purchase.\n\nDoes anyone know if they’re already sold out, or if they get released at a later date?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!",
